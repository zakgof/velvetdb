#Overview

Velvetdb is a general purpose nosql embedded data storage.

Yes, we offer yet another persistence framework, but its design is based on principles making velvetdb distinct:
- **Least intrusive.**  
 We won't force developers to design their data model *around* the persistence framework. No need to extend framework's base classes or implement framework's interfaces. Persist your POJOs with no or minimal limitations and no or minimal framework dependencies. You can even use 3rd party model classes if needed.
- **Decoupled where possible.**  
 In our API we try to keep all concepts separated as much as possible. Entities do not know anything about their Relationships. Queries are objects that can be pre-created and separated from application's business logics.

##Data model fundamentals
- **Data is a Graph**. Graph is a natural structure for most real data. Nodes are entities, edges represent relationships.
- **Entity** is a POJO. Basic CRUD operations are applicable.
- An entity should either have a **Primary key** or framework will assign it an autogenerated key. Range queries are supported for sortable primary keys.
- **Secondary indexes** are supported with range queries applicable.
- One-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many **relationships** are supported. Range queries on linked entities are supported.

##Other features

- Transactional
- Pure Java 8. No xmls or other config files needed
- Choice of file storage backend: [xodus](https://github.com/JetBrains/xodus) or [mapdb](https://github.com/jankotek/mapdb)
- Pluggable serialization library (built-in serializer / [kryo] (https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/kryo) / [elsa](https://github.com/jankotek/elsa))

Coming soon:
- Schema migration support
- Android support
